# 5\. Understanding Reinforcement Learning Tasks

## Introduction

All right guys, welcome to this video where we are going to talk about the different types of tasks in reinforcement learning. We have looked at reinforcement learning, its components, and solution framework, so we're going to look at the types of tasks that exist in reinforcement learning.

## Task Classification

### Types of Tasks

In general, all the tasks in reinforcement learning can be classified into two subtypes:

1. **Episodic Tasks**
2. **Continuous Tasks**

### Episodic Tasks

- Just look up your dictionary to see what episodic means. What is an episodic task? Like you watch movies, what is an episode? One episode ends, another starts, and ends, so something that has a start and an end right. That's what we can say is an episodic task.
- For example, in trading, if you want to trade and record your performance on a monthly basis, you only trade from the 1st to the 31st and then you take a record at the start of the month to the end of the month. This makes your trading episodic, where the start point is the first day of the month, and the endpoint is the last day of the month.
- An episodic task can be represented in a form of a state-action-reward sequence.

### Continuous Tasks

- Now let's look at what a continuous task is. A continuous task is just a task that goes on forever; it never ends.
- For example, if you're a trader, you can trade every day until infinity. Your children can take over your account, and your grandchildren can continue to trade as well. The trading never ends, as opposed to episodic where you keep your records on a monthly basis.
- A continuous task can be represented as a sequential loop where N is infinity, indicating that it will never stop.

## Solving Reinforcement Learning Tasks

- So, we have seen that we have these two types of tasks. How do we solve reinforcement learning tasks?
- We want to build an agent that takes actions that maximize our expected reward, like in day trading, which gives us the best reward in a month, week, or year. We want to build an agent, but how do we go about building that agent?
- As we've already seen, our framework states that the agent has to learn to make a profit. In reinforcement learning, we say that this agent learns a policy.

### Agent and Policy

- The agent learns this policy after interacting with the environment. It learns the policy by taking states from this environment, getting feedback through the reward, and taking actions. It uses this policy to take actions, which are used to select the best actions that yield the best rewards.
- Our agent is learning to get the best policy that results in the best decisions and outcomes. The ultimate goal is to train an agent until it becomes a champion, finding an optimal policy. For instance, if you can make a 21.7% return in a month, that’s a great policy.
- It’s essential to understand that although you're trading, you train this agent in an environment.

## Example: The Premier League Analogy

- Let’s use the Premier League as an analogy. You don’t need to win every game to become the champion of the league; you need to win the highest number of games compared to other teams. Similarly, for our agent, we are training it to be able to enter a league—which constitutes a trading environment—and gather the best points possible.
- If you want to test the strength of your agent, take it to another league, such as the Champions League, to see how far it goes, or to the World Cup to evaluate its performance among different teams.

## The Policy as the Brain

- Our policy is like the brain of the agent, defining its behavior. The way the agent makes decisions is based on this policy, which is a mathematical function that we want to learn.
- The agent learns a policy to behave in a market environment. This policy functions as a function that works in the environment, with the goal of maximizing profit.

### Understanding Functions in Reinforcement Learning

- In reinforcement learning, a function (like a function of price) can help determine what action to take when the agent sees a certain price. For example, this function might indicate whether to buy, sell, or hold based on varying price points.
- So, when you see a price of 20,000 for Bitcoin, what action should you take? The same goes for 50,000 or 120,000. Through learning, the policy will adapt to make decisions based on price points, functioning as the decision-making brain of the agent.
