# 2\. Understanding Reinforcement Learning: Components and Structure

## Introduction

All right guys. Um yeah this is a video number three in this series. And uh here we are going to talk about the components, the different components that make up reinforcement learning. If you haven't watched the first two videos or the previous videos that introduce reinforcement learning, please do. Or if you already know what reinforcement learning is, then you can just go ahead.

## Components of Reinforcement Learning

### Environment

So uh like we already saw, the components that make up reinforcement learning always have an environment. If you recall, an environment is where the agent learns. Right? So in the context of day trading, let's say we want to learn how to trade cryptocurrencies. So we are in a crypto trading environment, or if we want to learn how to trade stocks, we are in a stock trading environment.

### State

That environment produces a state. Right? So a state is just like, okay let's say you have trading days from day one to the last day of the year. So you are in a stock trading environment. That environment is going to give you a state. Maybe if you—let's say today—it's going to give you the price of that asset today. So that's an observation. An observation is, you know, it's produced by an environment. So today, the price of today, the price of tomorrow; those are states, those are different states.

### Agent

And then we have an agent, right? This is our AI agent that we want to train to make decisions. Right? So this agent takes actions and these actions produce rewards based on the environment. So these are the five components that we have for reinforcement learning.

### Action and Reward

So in the context of trading, we can have a trading environment, and then this environment produces a state. Let's just say, in simple terms, a simple example: the state today is the price of that asset today. For example, if we are trading Bitcoin, that's the price of Bitcoin today. If we are trading Apple shares, it's the price of Apple shares today, produced by that environment. So tomorrow, the state will be the price of the asset tomorrow.

When we have an agent that makes decisions, right? So the decisions are like, okay, when you see a state, you're going to make and take an action. Right? You can either buy, hold, or sell this asset. When it buys and sells this asset, it's going to be rewarded. Right? So the reward is either a profit or a loss depending on the next date.

Whenever it takes an action, the action is evaluated in the environment to see if it was a good or bad action. If it was a good action, it gets a reward; a positive reward means it was doing it well. A negative reward means the action was bad.

## Linking the Components Together

### Feedback Loop

So this reward design can be analyzed to make certain statements. We can say that an environment outputs a state or an observation; we're going to explain in detail later what this is. Right? So, like we can see from the picture, we know that an agent takes an action. Right? The agent receives a reward based on the state, action, and next state.

You can see the different components of reinforcement learning and what their roles are. To put it more into perspective, let's see how we can link the components together.

### Trading Example

So we can do this by—we already gave you the structure before—and so we're just going to explain how this structure is. You have a trading environment, right? In this trading environment, it's going to produce a state. Based on this state, this state is going to be sent to the agent. So the agent is going to see the state, which is like, a simple example. Let me keep saying it—it's the price. Ok, I'm going to see the price of the asset that I want to trade.

When I see the price, I'm going to make a decision. So our agent, our AI agent, sees the price and decides what to do. It's going to say, "Am I going to buy, hold or sell?" So if you decide to buy, it buys, and that action is recognized by the environment, which takes note of the action it took and is going to reward the agent.

### Learning Process

This means it’s going to inform the agent whether that action was bad or good based on the observation it saw. So it’s going to learn which observations are best for what actions. The price—I'm just using the price as an example here—is going to be evaluated. We’re going to see what an observation really is in future videos.

So this reward is going to be sent to the agent to inform it that the action it took was a bad action or that the action it took was a good action. The feedback to the agent is the reward. You can see how the components of reinforcement learning are linked together.

This happens over and over again until the agent learns a good strategy. Right? The good thing with reinforcement learning is that, like you, you learn, and the future is going, and you're learning. Right? We can get data from the past and teach this agent to learn how to trade by simulation. Right? We can do these simulations more than a thousand times, and the agent will learn like, "Okay, these are the best actions," and it's going to learn a strategy.

## Conclusion

So that's a simple way that we can explain how to link these components of reinforcement learning. This picture is not the ideal one; there are so many different designs for composing and explaining the framework for reinforcement learning. But this is my design of how I think I can put it.
