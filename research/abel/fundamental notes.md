# Fundamentals

## 1) Financial Ratios - Measures Profitability of the Company

### i) PAT Margin
$\text{PAT Margin} = \frac{\text{Profit After Tax}}{\text{Total Revenue}}$

### ii) EBITDA (Earnings Before Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization)
$\text{EBITDA Margin} = \frac{\text{EBITDA}}{\text{Operating Expenses}}$

$\text{Operating Expenses} = \text{Total Expenses} - \text{Financial Cost} - \text{Depreciation and Amortization}$

### iii) Return on Assets (ROA)
$\text{ROA} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Assets}}$

### iv) Return on Equity (ROE)
$\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}}$

### v) Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
$\text{EBIT} = \text{PAT} + \text{Tax} + \text{Interest}$

$\text{ROCE} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Overall Capital Employed}}$

**Overall Capital Employed**:
$\text{Short-term Debt} + \text{Long-term Debt} + \text{Equity}$

or

$\text{Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}$

### Noted Points on Financial Ratios
- ROE of 15% is good.
- ROE does not take liability into consideration.
- If ROCE is higher than ROE, it signifies the company has little or no debt.
- If ROE is greater than ROCE, it indicates the balance sheet is leveraged; ensure it generates profit.
- The gap between ROE and ROCE should be minimal.

## 2) Leverage Ratios

### i) Interest Coverage Ratio
$\text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Payment}}$

### ii) Debt to Equity Ratio
$\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}}$

### iii) Financial Leverage Ratio
$\text{Financial Leverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Average Total Assets}}{\text{Average Total Equity}}$

### Noted Points on Leverage Ratios
- Debt to equity ratio should be less than 1.
- Financial leverage ratio should be lower.

## 3) Valuation Ratios

### i) Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)
$\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Stock Price}}{\text{Earnings Per Share}}$

### ii) Price-to-Book Value per Share
$\text{Price to Book Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Current Stock Price}}{\text{Book Value Per Share}}$

**Book Value Per Share (BVPS)**:
The amount shareholders would receive if the company liquidated all its assets and paid off all its liabilities. It helps in determining a company's stock value and predicting its future market price.

### iii) Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S Ratio)
$\text{P/S Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Stock Price}}{\text{Sales Per Share}}$

### iv) Sales Per Share
$\text{Sales Per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Number of Shares}}$

---

## 4) Operating Ratios

### i) Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio
$\text{Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Operating Revenue}}{\text{Average Fixed Asset}}$

### ii) Total Asset Turnover
$\text{Total Asset Turnover} = \frac{\text{Operating Revenue}}{\text{Average Total Asset}}$

### iii) Working Capital Turnover Ratio
$\text{Working Capital Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Average Working Capital}}$

**Working Capital**:
$\text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}$

### iv) Inventory Turnover Ratio
$\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}}$

**Cost of Goods Sold**:
Cost of materials + Purchase of stock in trade + Stores & spares + Power & fuel + Cost of packing materials.

### v) Accountable Receivable Turnover Ratio
$\text{Accountable Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Operating Revenue}}{\text{Average Receivables}}$

### vi) Day Sales Outstanding
$\text{Day Sales Outstanding} = \frac{365}{\text{Receivable Turnover Ratio}}$

### Noted Points on Operating Ratios
- A high accountable receivable turnover ratio indicates the company collects cash more frequently.
